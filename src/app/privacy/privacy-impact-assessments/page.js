        A Privacy Impact Assessment is a tool that enables
        organizations to identify, categorize, and ultimately
        remediate privacy risks present in their data systems per
        relevant legislative standards. The objectives of these
        assessments are a few: to verify the data system's privacy
        conformity with organizational and legal requirements, to
        determine the privacy risks present in the data system, and to
        evaluate solutions to mitigate identified risks.

        Understanding what constitutes a PIA and its goals, a natural
        follow-up question would be who needs one. The necessity of
        one largely depends on the requirements of whatever
        regulations your business must abide by â€“ different frameworks
        require these assessments at different stages of data
        handling. Odds are, however, that if you are bound to privacy
        legislation and handle customer Personally Identifiable
        Information (PII) you will at minimum be required to conduct a
        PIA when said data is newly processed or sold. Additionally,
        whenever significant changes/additions are made to the data
        system's structure or its processes, then a PIA is typically
        highly advised, if not required outright.

          In the data mapping and risk identification step, a comprehensive

          collection, use, and handling of personal information are identified
          and assessed, taking into account factors such as sensitivity,
          purpose, and potential impact on individuals.

          privacy concerns. The findings of the Privacy Impact Assessment,
          including identified risks, privacy safeguards, and compliance
          measures, are documented. Necessary approvals are then obtained before
          implementing the project, ensuring that recommended privacy rules are
          integrated into the design and operations.
