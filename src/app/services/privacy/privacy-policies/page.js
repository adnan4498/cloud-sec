        Privacy Policy is a legal document that details the information you
        collect on users, the purpose and methods of that collection, and how
        that information will be processed or sold. What constitutes "personal"
        information varies by regulation, but a nice rule-of-thumb is that if
        the data can be used to personally identify an individual (things like
        names, addresses, emails, or age) it's safe to consider it personal.
      </div>
      <div className="mt-6">
        In terms of purpose, these policies primarily exist to protect customer
        privacy rights and to encourage transparency and consumer trust in
        businesses. Past these conceptual benefits lies one critical, tangible
        one for businesses â€“ reducing legal liability in an increasingly
        privacy-concerned world. Crucial in seeing those benefits, however, is
        the comprehensiveness of the policy. A privacy policy should be
        specifically crafted for your company. It should be an intricate and
        intentional guide for how you agree to not only protect your clients but
        ultimately how you will protect your company as well.
