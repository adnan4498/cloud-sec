        A tabletop exercise is an informal, discussion-based session in which a
        team discusses their roles and responses during an emergency, walking
        through one or more example scenarios. The atmosphere is collegial and
        exploratory and is not meant to put participants in the mindset theyâ€™d
        have during a disaster. Tabletop exercises are used to prepare for all
        sorts of crises, but cybersecurity and disaster recovery are common
        areas of focus. Tabletop exercises are designed to expose weaknesses in
        organizational structures and to make sure that people follow protocols
        and best practices. After all, the best-laid plans often fall apart when
        real-world humans have to implement them. While there are plenty of ways
        to test the technical aspects, a tabletop exercise tests the human and
        organizational factors that are just as important for cybersecurity.
